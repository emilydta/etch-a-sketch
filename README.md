# etch-a-sketch

A simple online Etch-A-Sketch where the user can hover over the grid squares to change their colour. 

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/

<h2>Reflection</h2>

Completing this project has taught me:

  - How to use CSS grid in a project and how to reference it with JavaScript.
  - How to use the forEach method and how it works.
  - Idiosyncracies of removing elements and their place in the nodelist and DOM.
  - How to add a gradient background.
  - How to create a dynamic grid in JavaScript.
  - A better understanding of relative and absolute CSS units (e.g. percentages and vh/vw).
